        { "type": "text", "value": "Test multiple conditions in sequence and execute the first matching block" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "Create loops" },

      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "An else-if ladder allows you to test multiple conditions in sequence, executing the first matching block and then exiting the entire structure."

      "id": 2,
      "type": "text",
      "question": "How many blocks execute in an else-if ladder?",
      "options": [
        { "type": "text", "value": "All of them" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "Only one - the first true condition" },

        { "type": "text", "value": "None" }
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Only one block executes in an else-if ladder - once a condition is found to be true, its code runs and all remaining conditions are skipped."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "type": "text",
      "question": "Why does the order of conditions matter in an else-if ladder?",
      "options": [
        { "type": "text", "value": "It doesn't matter" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "Only for performance" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "Earlier broad conditions might prevent specific conditions from being reached" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "For alphabetical organization" }
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The order matters because if conditions are ordered incorrectly, earlier broad conditions might prevent more specific conditions from ever being reached."

      "answer": 3,
      "explanation": "Conditions should be arranged from most specific to most general to ensure that specific cases are checked before more general ones."

      "question": "Is the final else clause in an else-if ladder required?",
      "options": [
        { "type": "text", "value": "No, but it's recommended as a catch-all for unmatched cases" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "Yes, always required" },

      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The final else clause is optional but recommended as it acts as a catch-all for any case that doesn't match the previous conditions."

      ],
      "answer": 3,
      "explanation": "Inner conditions in nested if statements are only evaluated if the outer conditions are true, creating dependent decision-making."
    },

      "id": 9,
      "type": "text",
      "question": "When are nested if statements most useful?",
      "options": [
        { "type": "text", "value": "When you have dependent conditions where checking the second only makes sense if the first is true" },

        { "type": "text", "value": "Always use else-if" },

      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Use else-if when checking mutually exclusive conditions in a single category. Use nested if statements when conditions are dependent or belong to different categories."
