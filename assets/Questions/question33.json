    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": "text",
      "question": "What does the this keyword refer to?",
      "options": [
        { "type": "text", "value": "The current object whose method or constructor is being called" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "The previous object" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "The class itself" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "A static variable" }
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The this keyword is a special reference that refers to the current object - the object whose method or constructor is being called."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "type": "text",
      "question": "What is the most common use of the this keyword?",
      "options": [
        { "type": "text", "value": "To create new objects" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "To distinguish between instance variables and parameters with the same name" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "To delete objects" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "To call static methods" }
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The most common use of this is to distinguish between instance variables and parameters that have the same name, particularly in constructors."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "type": "text",
      "question": "In the statement this.name = name, what does this.name refer to?",
      "options": [
        { "type": "text", "value": "The parameter" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "A local variable" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "The instance variable" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "A static variable" }
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "In this.name = name, this.name refers to the instance variable of the current object, while name (without this) refers to the parameter."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "type": "text",
      "question": "What happens if you write name = name instead of this.name = name in a constructor?",
      "options": [
        { "type": "text", "value": "It works perfectly" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "It creates a new variable" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "It deletes the instance variable" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "The parameter is assigned to itself, instance variable remains unchanged" }
      ],
      "answer": 3,
      "explanation": "Without this, you'd be assigning the parameter to itself. The instance variable would remain unchanged because Java looks for the closest variable with that name."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "type": "text",
      "question": "Can you use this to call other constructors in the same class?",
      "options": [
        { "type": "text", "value": "Yes, using this() to enable constructor chaining" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "No, never" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "Only in static constructors" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "Only in abstract classes" }
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "You can use this() to call other constructors in the same class. This is called constructor chaining and helps reduce code duplication."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "type": "text",
      "question": "Where must the this() constructor call be placed in a constructor?",
      "options": [
        { "type": "text", "value": "Anywhere in the constructor" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "As the first statement in the constructor" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "As the last statement" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "In the middle" }
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "When using this() to call another constructor, it must be the first statement in the constructor. You cannot have any code before the this() call."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "type": "text",
      "question": "Can you use this to pass the current object as a parameter to another method?",
      "options": [
        { "type": "text", "value": "No, this cannot be passed" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "Only to static methods" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "Yes, to provide a reference to the current object" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "Only in constructors" }
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The this keyword can be used to pass the current object as a parameter to another method, which is useful when you need to provide a reference to the current object."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "type": "text",
      "question": "What is method chaining?",

        { "type": "text", "value": "Creating method loops" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "Returning this from methods to enable multiple calls in one statement" }
      ],
      "answer": 3,
      "explanation": "Method chaining is enabled by returning this from methods, allowing multiple method calls to be strung together in a single statement."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "type": "text",
      "question": "Is this required when there's no naming conflict between parameters and instance variables?",
      "options": [
        { "type": "text", "value": "No, it's optional but can improve clarity" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "Yes, always required" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "Only in constructors" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "Only in methods" }
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The this keyword is required when there's a naming conflict, but it's optional (though often helpful for clarity) when there's no conflict."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "type": "text",
      "question": "Can you use this in static methods?",
      "options": [
        { "type": "text", "value": "Yes, always" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "No, because static methods belong to the class, not to any specific object" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "Only for static variables" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "Yes, but only in constructors" }
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The this keyword cannot be used in static methods because static methods belong to the class, not to any specific object instance."
    },

      "id": 11,
      "type": "text",
      "question": "What is shadowing in the context of instance variables?",

        { "type": "text", "value": "Copying variables" }
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Shadowing occurs when a parameter hides an instance variable with the same name, which can cause subtle bugs if this is not used."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "type": "text",
      "question": "Does using this improve code clarity?",
      "options": [
        { "type": "text", "value": "No, it makes code confusing" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "Only for beginners" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "It slows down programs" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "Yes, it makes it explicitly clear when referring to instance variables" }
      ],
      "answer": 3,
      "explanation": "Using this consistently improves code clarity by making it explicitly clear when you're referring to an instance variable, even when there's no naming conflict."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "type": "text",
      "question": "What benefit does constructor chaining with this() provide?",
      "options": [
        { "type": "text", "value": "It reduces code duplication" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "It makes programs faster" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "It uses less memory" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "It creates more objects" }

      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Constructor chaining with this() helps reduce code duplication by allowing one constructor to call another, avoiding repeated initialization code."

      "question": "In method chaining, what does returning this accomplish?",
      "options": [
        { "type": "text", "value": "Deletes the object" },

        { "type": "text", "value": "Makes the method static" }
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Returning this from a method allows multiple method calls to be chained together in a single statement, with each method operating on the same object."
    },

      "id": 15,
      "type": "text",
      "question": "What happens if you forget to use this when there's a naming conflict?",
      "options": [
        { "type": "text", "value": "The program crashes" },
        { "type": "text", "value": "A compilation error occurs" },

      ],
      "answer": 3,
      "explanation": "Forgetting to use this when there's a naming conflict results in the parameter being assigned to itself, and the instance variable remains unchanged, causing a subtle bug."

      "type": "text",
      "question": "Why is using this considered good practice in constructors?",
